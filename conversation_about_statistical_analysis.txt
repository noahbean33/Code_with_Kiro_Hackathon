Short answer: do a **pilot**, then size $n$ from the variance you observe. Expect **\~12–36 sessions** to get tight, defensible estimates; **\~16** is a practical minimum, **\~30–40** is a gold standard if you want very tight CIs.

Here’s the scientific way to choose $n$ for repeating your “vibe coding” on the same project:

# 1) Decide what you’re measuring

Pick objective scores per session (automate as much as possible):

* **Quality:** tests passed, lints/static analysis warnings, cyclomatic complexity, duplication %, performance benchmarks, bug count from a fixed review checklist, readability score (rubric).
* **Consistency:** variance of those scores across sessions; e.g., within-person SD or coefficient of variation (CV).
* **Time/effort:** wall time, keystrokes/edits, #compiles.

# 2) Run a pilot (8–10 sessions)

Use identical constraints (timebox, prompts, tools). From the pilot, compute:

* Sample SD of the quality metric, $\hat\sigma$.
* Single-session reliability (optional): ICC or test–retest $r$.

# 3) Choose $n$ to hit your precision target

If you want the **mean quality** to have a 95% CI half-width $m$ (e.g., ±5 points on a 0–100 scale):

$$
n \;=\; \left(\frac{1.96\,\hat\sigma}{m}\right)^2
$$

Examples (plug in pilot $\hat\sigma$):

* If $\hat\sigma = 10$ and you want $m=5$: $n \approx (1.96\cdot10/5)^2 \approx 16$.
* If $\hat\sigma = 15$ and $m=5$: $n \approx 35$.

# 4) If you care about **consistency/reliability**

Estimate single-session reliability $r_{\text{single}}$ (e.g., ICC). Averaging $k$ sessions increases reliability via **Spearman–Brown**:

$$
r_k \;=\; \frac{k\,r_{\text{single}}}{1 + (k-1)\,r_{\text{single}}}
$$

Solve for $k$ to reach a target $r_k$ (e.g., 0.80):

$$
k \;=\; \frac{r_k(1 - r_{\text{single}})}{r_{\text{single}}(1 - r_k)}
$$

Example: if $r_{\text{single}}=0.5$ and you want $r_k=0.8$, then $k \approx 4$ sessions averaged.

# 5) Heuristics if you can’t pilot first

* **Usable** estimate of mean & variance: **12–16 sessions**.
* **Tight 95% CI (±5 on a 0–100 scale)** with typical coding-score SDs (10–15): **\~16–35 sessions**.
* **Very stable reliability (≥0.8) by averaging sessions**: often **3–6** sessions if single-session reliability is moderate (0.4–0.6).

# 6) Practical design tips

* Fix the **timebox**, repo baseline, and **prompt** to reduce extraneous variance.
* Randomize session order/day to avoid fatigue and learning effects.
* Lock toolchain/linters; use the **same test suite** each time.
* Pre-register the metrics & analysis (even in a README) to keep it honest.

If you want, give me one target metric (e.g., “overall quality score 0–100, want ±5 CI”) and your best guess of SD from past runs, and I’ll spit out a concrete $n$ right now.

Yeah — if you frame it as

“We didn’t just build or copy a shell — we validated Kiro’s approach with statistical rigor.”

…that’s instant judge-bait.
Hackathons love projects that teach something new and use hard data to back it up.

You could position it as:

Project Concept

Implement smallsh both ways:

Your baseline (class assignment style).

Kiro’s structured, enum/struct-heavy design.

Run n repeated coding sessions building the same shell from scratch in each style.

Measure quality, speed, and spec compliance per session.

Apply statistical analysis to see if Kiro’s design yields:

Higher mean quality

Lower variance (more consistent results)

Faster completion times

What Makes It Stand Out

You’re not just showing code — you’re doing empirical software engineering.

Real hypothesis: “Kiro’s design produces more consistent, spec-compliant shells.”

Uses methods from psychometrics (ICC, confidence intervals) in a hackathon setting — unusual and memorable.

Teaches why structured design matters to reliability and accuracy.

Data Storytelling for Judges

On your Devpost/demo:

Show two plots:

Mean vs variance plot (Kiro’s bars smaller & higher).

Learning curve plot (quality vs session number).

Heatmap of spec compliance by run/session.

A big “Statistical significance achieved (p < 0.05)” badge.

How to Make the Numbers Pop

Use automated grading scripts to score each run identically.

Keep all other variables fixed (timebox, prompt, environment).

Show reliability stats:

n, mean, SD, 95% CI for each style.

ICC for repeatability.

Bonus: run a paired t-test (same coder doing both styles).

Tagline for Submission

“Proving software design quality — statistically.
We show that Kiro’s shell design yields consistent, accurate, and spec-compliant results, every time.”

If you want, I can outline the exact experiment protocol you’d follow so it’s repeatable and judge-proof, with 
𝑛
n chosen for enough statistical power to make the claim.
Do you want me to write that? That’s the kind of thing that will really make this competition entry airtight.
